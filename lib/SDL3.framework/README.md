SDL3-3.1.6

Dev Note: 
I struggled to get Zig and ZLS to recognize this folder layout.
When a new version is released, follow this layout precisely.
And everything should compile and ZLS should also do syntax
highlightling for SDL3.

New SDL3 releases can be [had here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases)
